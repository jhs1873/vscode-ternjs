# vscode-ternjs

Integrates [ternjs](http://ternjs.net/) into VSCode

## Features

VSCode's builtin javascript supporting such as auto-completion goto-definition work fine in most cases, but in some other cases
the results of ternjs are better.So this extension brings ternjs into VSCode.

## Extension Settings

You need to provide a config file named `.tern-project` under to root of your workspace, you can generate a default one by using the command `ternjs.generateConfig` - just use shortcut `⇧⌘P` to open command palette and then type the command.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Supports goto definition.
